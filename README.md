# Pause
## A Web App to detect procrastination through Deep Neural Networks

Pause is a Web App that detects procrastination through a deep neural network, using modern facial and emotional recognition technologies to form a binary classifier of a person either procrastinating or not procrastinating. This project was built by Natasha Wong (Front End/Web Dev) and Ervin Baccay (Back End/Data Science) for CalHacks 5.0.
